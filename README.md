Many factors play into how learners acquire knowledge when being taught by educators. This includes the methods in which they are taught and how learners perceive and understand what they are taught. Of the many methods of teaching there lies game- based learning, whose aim is to aid in the acquisition of knowledge in a more interactive and potentially efficient way.

What has been noted by educators is that video games have been excellent mediums for teaching players how to play them. Other methods looked into to understand how learners learn with the aim of personalising teaching to increase attainment are learning styles; which are approaches to ways of learning which involve using qualities that are unique to a learner to allow teachers to present information in a more accessible way. 

So now the question becomes, What would happen if we were to combine these two aspects together along with aspects found in video games that aid in learning and providing a challenge? This is the question this project seeks to investigate. Whether personalised learning is possible through the use of Learning styles and Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment - an aspect found within video games.
